=head1 NAME

amqpclt 0.4 - versatile AMQP client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<amqpclt> I<[OPTIONS]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION


B<amqpclt> is a versatile tool to interact with messaging brokers speaking
AMQP and/or message queues (see :py:mod:`messaging.queue`) on disk.

It receives messages (see :py:mod:`messaging.message`) from an incoming
module, optionally massaging them (i.e. filtering and/or modifying), and
sends them to an outgoing module. Depending on which modules are used,
the tool can perform different operations.

Here are the supported incoming modules:

=over

=item *

broker: connect to a messaging broker using AMQP, subscribe to one
  or more queues and receive the messages sent by the broker

=item *

queue: read messages from a message queue on disk
  (see :py:mod:`messaging.queue`)

=back

Here are the supported outgoing modules:

=over

=item *

broker: connect to a messaging broker using AMQP and send the messages

=item *

queue: store the messages in a message queue on disk
  (see :py:mod:`messaging.queue`)

=back

Here are some frequently used combinations:

=over

=item *

incoming broker + outgoing queue: drain some destinations, storing
  the messages on disk

=item *

incoming queue + outgoing broker: (re-)send messages that have been
  previously stored on disk, optionally with modifications (such as
  altering the destination)

=item *

incoming broker + outgoing broker: shovel messages from one broker
  to another

=back

See the "EXAMPLES" sections for concrete examples.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE


B<amqpclt> can read its options from a configuration file. For this,
the Perl Config:General module is used and the option names are the
same as on the command line. For instance:

    daemon = true
    pidfile = /var/run/amqpclt.pid
    incoming-queue = path=/var/spool/amqpclt
    outgoing-broker-uri = amqp://broker.acme.com:5672/virtual_host
    outgoing-broker-auth = "plain name=guest pass=guest"

Alternatively, options can be nested:

    <outgoing-broker>
        uri = amqp://broker.acme.com:5672/virtual_host
        auth = "plain name=guest pass=guest"
    </outgoing-broker>

Or even:

    <outgoing>
        <broker>
            uri = amqp://broker.acme.com:5672/virtual_host
            <auth>
                scheme = plain
                name = guest
                pass = guest
            </auth>
        </broker>
    </outgoing>

The options specified on the command line have precedence over the
ones found in the configuration file.


=head1 CALLBACK


B<amqpclt> can be given python code to execute on all processed messages.
This can be used for different purposes:

=over

=item *

massaging: the code can change any part of the message, including setting
  or removing header fields

=item *

filtering: the code can decide if the message must be given to the
  outgoing module or not

=item *

displaying: the code can print any part of the message

=item *

copying: the code can store a copy of the message into files or
  message queues

=back

To use callbacks, the --callback-path or --callback-code option must be used.
The python code must provide functions with the following signature:

=over

=item *

start(self, DATA)
  (optional) this will be called when the program starts, with the supplied
  data (see the --callback-data option) as a list reference

=item *

check(self, MESSAGE)
  (mandatory) this will be called when the program has one message to process;
  it will be given the message (see messaging.message.Message) and must return
  either a message (it could be the same one or a new one) or a string
  describing why the message has been dropped

=item *

idle(self)
  (optional) this will be called when the program has no message to process

=item *

stop(self)
  (optional) this will be called when the program stops

=back

The code can be put in a file, on the command line or in the B<amqpclt>
configuration file, using the "here document" syntax.

Here is an example (to be put in the B<amqpclt> configuration file) that
prints on stdout a JSON array of messages:

    callback-code = <<EOF
    def start (self):
        self.count = 0
    def check(self, msg):
        if self.count:
            sys.stdout.write(", ")
        else:
            sys.stdout.write("[")
        self.count += 1
        sys.stdout.write(msg.serialize())
        return msg
    def stop(self):
        if self.count:
            sys.stdout.write("]\n")
        else:
            sys.stdout.write("[]\n")
    EOF

For simple callback code that only needs the check subroutine, it is enough
to supply the "inside code". If the function definition is missing,
the supplied code will be wrapped with:

    def check(self, msg):
        hdr = msg.header
        ... your code goes here ...
        return msg

This allows for instance to remove the message-id header with something like:

  $ amqpclt ... --callback-code 'del(hdr["foo"])'


=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 SENDING


Here is an example of a configuration file for a message sender
daemon (from queue to broker), forcing the persistent header to true
(something which is highly recommended for reliable messaging) and
setting the destination:

    # define the source message queue
    <incoming-queue>
     path = /var/spool/sender
    </incoming-queue>
    # modify the message header on the fly
    callback-code = <<EOF
        hdr["destination"] = "/queue/app1.data"
        hdr["persistent"] = "true"
    EOF
    # define the destination broker
    <outgoing-broker>
        uri = "amqp://broker.acme.com:5672/virtual_host"
    </outgoing-broker>
    # miscellaneous options
    reliable = true
    pidfile = /var/run/sender.pid
    daemon = true
    loop = true
    remove = true


=head2 SHOVELING


Here is an example of a configuration file for a message shoveler
(from broker to broker), clearing some headers on the fly so that messages
can be replayed safely:

    # define the source broker
    <incoming-broker>
        uri = "amqp://broker.acme.com:5672/virtual_host"
    </incoming-broker>
    # define the subscriptions
    <subscribe>
        destination = /queue/app1.data
    </subscribe>
    <subscribe>
        destination = /queue/app2.data
    </subscribe>
    # define the destination broker
    <outgoing-broker>
        uri = "amqp://dev-broker.acme.com:5672/virtual_host"
    </outgoing-broker>
    # modify the message destination
    callback-code = <<EOF
        hdr["destination"] = "/queue/dest_to_be_replayed"
    EOF


=head2 RECEIVING


Here is an example of a configuration file for a message receiver
(from broker to queue):

    # define the source broker
    <incoming-broker>
        uri = "amqp://broker.acme.com:5672/virtual_host"
        <auth>
            scheme = plain
            name = receiver
            pass = secret
        </auth>
    </incoming-broker>
    # define the subscriptions
    <subscribe>
        destination = /queue/app1.data
    </subscribe>
    <subscribe>
        destination = /queue/app2.data
    </subscribe>
    # define the destination message queue
    <outgoing-queue>
        path = /var/spool/receiver
    </outgoing-queue>
    # miscellaneous options
    pidfile = /var/run/receiver.pid

To run it as a daemon:

    $ amqpclt --conf test.conf --daemon

To use the configuration file above with some options
on the command line to drain the queues:

    $ amqpclt --conf test.conf --timeout-inactivity 10


=head2 TAPPING


Callback code can also be used to tap messages, i.e. get a copy of all
messages processed by B<amqpclt>. Here is some callback code for this purpose
that could for instance be merged with the shoveling code above.
It also shows how to use the --callback-data option:

    callback-code = <<EOF
        def start(self, path, qtype="DQS"):
            self.tap_queue = queue.new({"path" : path, "type" : qtype})

        def check(self, msg):
            self.tap_queue.add_message(msg)
            return msg
    EOF

Callback data must be given to specify which message queue to use:

    $ amqpclt --conf tap.conf --callback-data "/tmp/tap,DQS"
